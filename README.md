## Description
A PWA Budget Tracker that works regardless of network connection. If the user is offline, their transactions will be stored in IndexedDB until they next load the page with a working internet connection, at which point their offline connections will be synced with the DB. Uses MongoDB, Express, and WebPack. This project was given as an assignment in the UC Berkley Full Stack development bootcamp. The front end of this application was supplied, along with server routes, and I implemented the IndexedDB loading functionality.

## Installation instructions
Clone the project and run ```npm install```

## Usage Information
Run ```mongod``` in a separate terminal in order to start MongoDB. Next, run ```npm start``` to start the server. You can throttle your internet connection in chrome developer tools to simulate losing connection.
